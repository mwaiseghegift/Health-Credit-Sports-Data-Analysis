# Football API Documentation

[Quickstart / API Reference](https://www.football-data.org/documentation/quickstart)

## Overview

On May 20, 2022 I released v4 for public use. I revised the entire reference documentation that you find here.

While v2 will remain available until further notice, I encourage you to migrate to v4. It's really worth it.

## Available resources

See all available endpoints underneath. See Filtering table at the very bottom to see how to pass filters in an adequate format. You can also get an overview by running all available calls through Postman by importing this collection after download.
