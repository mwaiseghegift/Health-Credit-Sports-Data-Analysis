## Overview

**Real-Time Sports Analytics** is an end-to-end data analytics system that fetches live football match and player data via the Football-Data.org API, stores it in a SQLite database, and visualizes real-time performance metrics through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

### What Does This Project Do?

- **Automated Data Collection**: Fetches football data from Football-Data.org API at configurable intervals
- **Persistent Storage**: Stores match and player statistics in SQLite database with incremental updates
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Computes performance metrics like efficiency, involvement rate, and form scores
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Provides visual insights through Streamlit with filters and dynamic charts
- **Scheduled Updates**: Automates data fetching every 10 minutes (configurable)

## Business Context

### The Problem

Coaches and analysts need **real-time insights** on player and team performance to make informed game decisions. Traditional methods of analyzing sports data are often:

- Manual and time-consuming
- Delayed, with outdated information
- Fragmented across multiple sources
- Difficult to visualize and interpret

### Our Solution

This system provides **live tracking** of football statistics (goals, assists, minutes played, team efficiency), enabling:

- Quick identification of trends and patterns
- Recognition of standout performers
- Detection of tactical weaknesses
- Data-driven decision making

### Business Questions Answered

1. **Which players show declining performance over time?**
   - Track form scores and efficiency trends

2. **How does player workload affect match efficiency?**
   - Analyze minutes played vs. performance metrics

3. **Can we monitor team momentum and performance in real time?**
   - View real-time standings and goal patterns

4. **Who are the top-performing players and which positions need improvement?**
   - Identify leaders and areas for tactical adjustments

### Data Flow

1. **Fetch**: `fetch_data.py` calls Football-Data.org API
2. **Store**: Raw responses saved as timestamped JSON snapshots
3. **Process**: `process_data.py` cleans and transforms data
4. **Load**: Processed data inserted into SQLite database via `db_utils.py`
5. **Visualize**: `app.py` queries database and displays interactive dashboard
6. **Automate**: `scheduler.py` orchestrates periodic updates

## Features

### Data Collection

- Secure API key management via `.env` file

### Data Storage

- Normalized SQLite database schema
- Separate tables for matches, player stats, and teams
- Foreign key relationships for data integrity

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **pip** package manager
- **Football-Data.org API Key** (free tier available)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gopala2026/Real-Time-Sports-Analytics-Player-Performance-Tracker.git
cd Real-Time-Sports-Analytics-Player-Performance-Tracker
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
python -m venv venv

# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

1. Edit `.env` and add your API key:

```env
FOOTBALL_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

**Get your free API key:** [Football-Data.org Registration](https://www.football-data.org/client/register)

### Step 5: Initialize Database

The database will be automatically created on first run. Optionally, you can initialize it manually:

```bash
python -c "from src.db_utils import get_database_manager; get_database_manager()"
```

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Fetch Data and Launch Dashboard

```bash
# Fetch initial data
python src/fetch_data.py

# Launch dashboard
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Option 2: Automated Scheduler

```bash
# Start scheduler (fetches data every 10 minutes)
python src/scheduler.py

# In another terminal, launch dashboard
streamlit run src/app.py
```

### Option 3: One-Time Fetch

```bash
# Fetch data once without scheduling
python src/scheduler.py --once
```

## Usage

### Fetching Data

**Manual fetch:**

```bash
python src/fetch_data.py
```

**Scheduled fetching:**

```bash
# Use default interval (10 minutes)
python src/scheduler.py

# Custom interval (30 minutes)
python src/scheduler.py --interval 30
```

### Processing Data

Data is automatically processed after fetching. To process existing snapshots:

```bash
python src/process_data.py
```

### Running the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

**Dashboard features:**

- Use sidebar filters to select teams, players, or date ranges
- Click "Refresh Data" to reload from database
- Click "Fetch Latest Data" to pull new data from API
- Hover over charts for detailed information

### Jupyter Notebooks

Explore data interactively:

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/01_explore_api.ipynb
```

## Dashboard Preview

### Main Dashboard

*[Screenshot will be added after first run]*

**Key Sections:**

- KPI Cards: Total matches, goals, assists, average efficiency
- Top Performers: Leaderboard of best players
- Performance Overview: Goals vs. Assists scatter plot
- Team Comparison: Total goals by team
- Trend Analysis: Performance metrics over time
- Workload Analysis: Minutes played vs. efficiency
- Key Insights: Automated findings and recommendations

## Key Insights

Based on the analytics system, here are example insights:

### Performance Insights

- **Top Scorers**: Identify leading goal scorers across competitions
- **Efficiency Leaders**: Players with highest goals+assists per minute
- **Form Trends**: Spot players with improving or declining performance
- **Workload Impact**: Correlation between minutes played and efficiency

### Team Insights

- **League Leaders**: Teams with most goals and best efficiency
- **Goal Distribution**: How goals are spread across matches
- **Tactical Patterns**: First-half vs. second-half performance
- **Substitution Impact**: Effect of fresh players on performance

### Actionable Recommendations

1. **Monitor Fatigue**: Players with 400+ minutes may show efficiency drops
2. **Tactical Adjustments**: Teams scoring mostly in one half may need strategy changes
3. **Squad Rotation**: High-workload players need rest to maintain performance
4. **Rising Stars**: Identify players with consistently improving form scores
