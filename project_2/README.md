# Banking Analytics: Credit Risk & Loan Default Prediction

## 🧭 Project Overview
This project uses real-world Bondora P2P loan data to analyze borrower characteristics, identify risk factors, and build a predictive model that estimates loan default probability. 

## 💼 Business Problem
Bondora’s P2P lending model allows investors to fund personal loans. However, defaults affect both investor returns and portfolio stability. Identifying high-risk borrowers early is crucial to minimize losses and optimize approval decisions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SQLAlchemy)
- **Database:** SQLite
- **Visualization:** Tableau
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
